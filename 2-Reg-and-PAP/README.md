Registration and Pre-Analysis Plans
===================================

by Eva Vivalt

You are cordially invited to work on a "many analysts" type project together! The first step is to write up a PAP specifying the analyses you will conduct. If you are working on your own project, complete the following with respect to your project, or you can walk through some PAPs of other projects (linked at the end of this) and think about what you would have done differently.

1. Draft a Pre-Analysis Plan

  a. Check out [Alejandro Ganimian's template](http://scholar.harvard.edu/alejandro_ganimian/classes/quantitative-methods-improving-causal-inference-educational-research-5). (The raw .tex file is on Github if you're a LaTeX user.)
  
Some parts will be more or less relevant for different projects. For our project, we will focus in on the "analysis" section. In your groups, pretend that you are collecting data from scratch, as a set of independent PIs, and discuss how you would answer the questions in each section.

Now let's focus in on the "analysis" section and get writing!

In particular, each group should decide on 1 "preferred specification" and several "robustness checks".

If a subsection is irrelevant, you do not have to fill it out. Please ask if you have any questions. To keep our analyses independent from each other, don't chat across groups at this stage (there will be time for that later!).

  b. When you are satisfied with your plan, sign up for an [OSF](http://www.osf.io) account and let me know so I can invite you to the project folder. Then you can create a sub-folder (name it "LastName1_LastName2_etc." after all the people in your group) and upload your plan to your sub-folder (name it "PAP_LastName1_LastName2_etc.").
  
2. Explore Registries

  a. Try to fill out (but don't go all the way to publishing) the [AEA Social Science Registry](http://socialscienceregistry.org) application pages or [Aspredicted.org](http://aspredicted.org)'s short form. Since you aren't collecting your own data, much will be irrelevant, but you can again pretend you are redesigning this study as an independent team of PIs interested in answering similar kinds of questions. Aspredicted has a demo version that self-destructs after 24 hours that you could try out.

  b. Check out how you would register a study with OSF. (Again, don't go all the way unless you're really serious about your work--you can't delete an OSF registration and there isn't a demo option.)

3. Additional PAPs you can check out:

  a. The WASH Benefits Project. An on-going water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition RCT in Kenya and Bangladesh. The project wrote [a protocol](http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e003476.short) that includes a relatively detailed statistical analysis plan. What information, if any, do you think is missing?

  b. The *Gobifo* community driven development project in Sierra Leone. Casey, Glennerster, and Miguel wrote a PAP [here](http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/assets/miguel_research/8/_Appendix__Reshaping_Institutions_-_Evidence__on__Aid__Impacts__Using__a__Pre___Analysis__Plan.pdf). The final paper is [here](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/sites/default/files/publications/45_reshaping%20institutions%20QJE.pdf). What information, if any, is missing? Is there analysis conducted that wasn't in the PAP?

  c. The Oregon Medicaid Expansion Lottery. Oregon had a lottery to expand Medicaid, leading to a good experimental design to study important health outcomes. The PAP and papers are all available [here](http://www.nber.org/oregon/).
